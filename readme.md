## !!Important

Due to limited time following things were not implemented

- Any tests
- Correct error handling
- Optimistic UI
- Field level validation (The form will crash now if you don't fill everything in)
- 2nd pass over the code to refactor less optimal/reusable code

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm i`
2. Run the app locally: `pnpm dev`
